Most importantly the event will try to introduce Free and Open Source Softwares and technologies that can be used on productive environment. The event consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Women Hackathon
\item Go Programming
\item Introduction To Big Data And Hadoop
\item Introduction to Docker and Kubernetes
\item Introduction To Machine Learning Using Apache Spark
\end{itemize}
